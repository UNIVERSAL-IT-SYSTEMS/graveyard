graveyard
=========

This overlay is to be used for packages tree-cleaned from the official portage
repository. Any user can volunteer to help maintaining this overlay.

Note that **nothing** in this overlay may be marked stable, even if it was
previously stable in portage.

If you think there is a reason to resurrect a package from this overlay, and
you are willing to maintain it in the official portage tree, then contact
proxy-maint@gentoo.org.

For now I will oversee this overlay, but others are welcome to step up.
